						<h4>Obituary</h4>
						<p>Helgi Thompson was born on December 15, 1900 on the family farm in the Big Point District, which at that time was known as Wild Oak, 
							Man. He was the fourth child born to Bjarni and Anna Tomasson (which was later changed to Thompson), who immigrated from Iceland to 
							Canada and settled in the Big Point District in 1900. Helgi attended the Big Point School and then worked on the family farm where 
							they raised beef cattle and commercial fished in the winters. </p>
						<p>In 1928, he married Hlif Johnson from Stony Hill, Man. whom he had met when she was teaching school at the Big Point school. She was 
							one of five children born to Brynjolfer and Margaret Johnson, who had immigrated from Iceland to Canada in 1900. Helgi and Hlif had 
							a family of twelve children. </p>
						<p>They first settled on a farm in the Langruth District, Sec. Here they were engaged in grain farming as well as raising beef cattle, 
							While  living on this farm, their oldest sons were born, In 1931, as the depression had hit and grain prices had dropped sharply, they 
							left this farm and moved to a farm in Big Point District on the shores of Lake Manitoba; Sec. 32-16-8. The family income here
							came from raising beef cattle and also Helgi was engaged in commercial fishing in the winter, which in those years became a major 
							source of income for the family. While residing on this farm nine more children were born and the older children attended the Big 
							Point School which was a distance of two miles away. In those days, there were no school buses, so the mode of travel to and from 
							school, was either by walking or by horses. In 1934, as the older children were now approaching the final grades taught in Big Point, 
							which was grade eight, the parents who wanted their children to get as much education as possible, decided now to move closer to a 
							high school, so the children could at least get their highschool education, The family moved to a farm close to the town of Langruth, 
							Sec, 29-16-9, where the youngest son Robert now resides. While  residing on this farm, the youngest son Robert was born, and all 
							the children attended the Langruth school, finishing their highschool and then going on to other endeavours. </p>
						<p>Helgi and Hlif were very active in community affairs. Helgi served as a School Trustee for many years on the Big Point School Board 
							and later on the Langruth School Board. The family were members Of the Lutheran Church and Helgi served as a member of the Church 
							Board as well as member of the Choir for many years. He also supported and worked on many Other community projects. Hlif was also 
							very dedicated to the Lutheran Ladies Aid for many years, as well as working for many other community organizations. </p>
						<p>When the children got older and some had left home, Hlif decided she wanted to go back teaching, and she taught for many years at 
							different schools, including Langruth, Arden and others, until illness forced her to give up teaching. </p>
						<p>As mentioned before Helgi and Hlif had a family of twelve of which eleven are now living. Clifford the oldest passed away in 1946. The 
							other children now living are, Stanley, Margaret, Eileen, Eleanor, Betty, Harold, May, Allan, Linda, Sylvia, and Robert. </p>
						<p>Stanley, the oldest living son, married Vera Smith of Shoal Lake, Man. They did not have any children and now live in Lockport, Man.</p>
						<p>Margaret married Keith Munro Of Amaranth, Man., and they have four children — David, Jamie, Myles, and Jennifer. They also have three grandchildren — 
							Matthew, Daniel, and Melanie. They now reside in Winnipeg, Man.</p>
						<p>Eileen married Mike Nesbitt of Schrieber, Ont. They have three children — Debra, Bruce and Perry, and one grandson Michael. Eileen now resides 
							in Winnipeg, Man. </p>
						<p>Betty married Lou Berthalet of Laurier, Man. They had three children — Donald, Gail and Nicole. Their son passed away in 1978, at the age of eighteen years. 
							They now live in Sault St. Marie, Ont. </p>
						<p>Harold married Joyce Boulton of Winnipeg. They have four children — Daniel, Shawna, Sherry and Mark. They still reside in Winnipeg, Man. </p>
						<p>May married Roger Ryplanski of Winnipeg, Man. They have four children — Ricky, Kimberley, Derek, and Crystal. They still reside in 
							Winnipeg, Man. </p>
						<p>Allan married Louise Bott of Langruth. They have four children — Brent, Lyle, Sandra, and Corinne, They now reside in Lockport, Man. </p>
						<p>Linda married Bruce Hoffstrom of Dryden. Ont., where they now live. They have four children — Lori, Karen, Heather and Steven.</p>
						<p>Sylvia married Clint Smith of Erickson, Man., and they now reside in Grande Prairie, Alta. They have three children — Michelle, David and Tammy. </p>
						<p>Robert, the only member of the family that still resides in the Langruth District, is farming the family farm. </p>
