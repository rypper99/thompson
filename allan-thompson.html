      <p>On January 17, 2025 at 85 years of age, Bjarni Allan Thompson passed away peacefully at the Selkirk Regional Health Centre.</p>
      <p>Allan is survived by his wife of 61 years Louise and his four children, Brent (Brenda), Lyle (Lynda), Sandra, Corinne (Brad) and his nine grandchildren, Eric, Michael, Kelsey, Teeson, Talin, Liam, Abigail, Brady and Brooke. Also by sisters Betty Berthelet, May Ryplanski and brother Robert Thompson, brother-in-law Clint Smith, sister-in-law Joyce Thompson, brother-in-law Allan Bott along with many nieces, nephews and friends.</p> 
      <p>Allan was predeceased by his parents Helgi and Hlif, brothers Clifford, Stanley (Vera), Harold, sisters Margaret (Keith), Eileen (Mike), Eleanor (Norm), Linda (Bruce), Sylvia, brothers-in-law Roger Ryplanski and Lou Berthelet, and son-in-law Jeff Smith.</p>
      <p>Allan was born in Langruth, Manitoba and raised on the family farm. After completing high school, he attended Teachers College in Winnipeg in 1959 - 60. Al’s teaching career spanned nearly twenty years taking him to places as Mulvihill, Altamont, Flin Flon, Selkirk, and Winnipeg. Al loved his time teaching and mentored many young people. He was respected by his students who remember him as always having their best interest at heart.</p>
      <p>In 1979, Al ventured into a new career when he and Louise purchased Skinners in Lockport, Manitoba. Al absolutely loved this new challenge. He had endless dreams which included building Skinners Wet n Wild Waterslide Park, Pitchers Bar and Grill, ball diamonds, and Grand Slam Batting Cages in Lockport. Al and Louise operated them until closing in 2004. He also expanded Skinners to the Forks Market in Winnipeg and operated it for 30 years.</p> 
      <p>Sports were an important part of Al’s life. He loved playing hockey and especially baseball/fastball. The hardest thing he had to do was hang up his cleats after he purchased Skinners. He was an avid hunter and loved his moose hunting trips to Northern Manitoba and deer hunting back in Langruth with his sons and close friends.</p>
      <p>Al was a community-minded person. He loved meetings and being part of a common purpose. He was a school trustee for the Lord Selkirk School Division for 5 years and a member of the Lockport Community Marketing Cooperation and Lockport Children's Festival for many years. Al was also active in politics and involved in many elections in Manitoba serving as campaign manager for candidates. He also coached his children in their various sports, always willing to volunteer when needed.</p>
      <p>Al loved to travel and visited many parts of the world with Louise and their family. Their trips to Iceland were most memorable for him. He completed his bucket list after they were able to take their nine grandchildren there. He was very proud of his Icelandic heritage and to share this with his grandchildren was a highlight of his life.</p> 
      <p>Al was a great husband, father, grandfather, brother, uncle and friend. His laid-back personality was appreciated by all who knew him. He would always take time for people and while he enjoyed a good debate, would always listen to another’s perspective. Al loved nothing more than a boat ride on the creek and a sing-song with family and friends - Green Green Grass of Home was his signature song. He will be deeply missed.</p>
      <p>The family would like to extend heartfelt thanks to Dr. Showue and the staff of Selkirk Regional Health Centre for the excellent care which Al received. Also, thank you to Gilbart’s Funeral Home for their compassionate care in arrangements.</p>
      <p>A celebration of life and luncheon will be held at Selkirk Rec Centre Hall on March 29, 2025 at 11:00 a.m.</p>
      <p>In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Children’s Hospital Foundation at https://goodbear.ca or #533A - 715 McDermot Ave., Winnipeg, MB R3E 1M6 or to a charity of your choice.</p>
