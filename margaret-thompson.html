<p>Peacefully on February 22, 2011 at the Health Sciences Centre, Anna Margaret Tomasson (Munro) passed away at the age of 79 years.</p>
<p>She was predeceased by parents, Helgi and Hlif Thompson, brothers Clifford and Stanley (Vera), sister Eleanor, son David and daughter Jennifer.</p>

 <p>She was born in Big Point, Manitoba and moved with the family to Langruth, Manitoba. She attended the University of Manitoba in 1950. She 
 later returned to university in her retirement years concentrating on Icelandic Studies and Economics. Twice her Icelandic Studies led 
 her to revisit her roots in Iceland where she re-connected with family. Her strong work ethic led to a career consisting of a variety of 
 accounting related jobs, retiring at the Winnipeg Tax Centre. During that time, she lived in a variety of communities where she raised her 
 four children. She ensured her family attended the local Lutheran church and in her later years she has been a member of the First Lutheran 
 Church in Winnipeg. 
 <p>In her retirement, she enjoyed playing bridge and lawn bowling while a resident of the Betelstadur Seniors Community. All family was important 
 to her and led her to keep in touch with her siblings and their families. She was a bold, intelligent, beautiful and independent Mother,
  Amma, and Long Amma who wanted her family to succeed in all they do.</p>
